# Microcontroller Based Snake Game
## Abstract
In this project it is aimed to recreate the classic snake game using Microchip PIC18 series microcontroller on Labcenter Proteus software. The game units are provided by connecting the necessary circuit components to the microcontroller on Proteus. The movement of the snake in the game is provided by an android application via the bluetooth module using UART serial communication. Graphical LCD is used to screen the game. The user is greeted by the start screen at the first opening. After selecting start option, the game enters main menu. Game settings can be changed through this menu. There are language option and sound options as settings. From scores option, users can see the highest score and the score of the last played game. For the gameplay, the user is offered three levels of difficulty. Such: easy, medium and hard. There are different maps at each level of difficulty. After selecting difficulty level of the game, there is a countdown from 3 to 1 and the game starts after the countdown finished.
## Components Used
* GLCD
* Loud Speaker
* Bluetooth Module
* Buttons (for interrupts)
* Microchip PIC18F46K22
* Mobile App (for snake movement)
